# ðŸ§© Module 1: Guessing Game with Print Statement

## ðŸŽ¯ Why This Module Matters  
- Teaches the foundational use of the `print()` function  
- Encourages creative thinking using only basic output  
- Helps students understand flow and structure without complex syntax  
- Great first step into programming without requiring user input or logic

## ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s New in This Module  
- Focuses purely on the use of `print()` to simulate interactivity  
- Introduces the concept of a game loop manually via printed statements  
- Students build a static guessing game scenario (no input, no conditions)

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts Introduced  
- **`print()`**: The most basic function in Python used to display output  
- **Static Simulation**: Pretending to create interactivity by printing all steps manually  
- **Game Structure Awareness**: Understanding how a guessing game is logically built, even without actual interaction
